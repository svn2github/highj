#summary List of missing features

= What's Missing =

== Tests ==

Tests, tests, tests.

== Monad Subclasses ==

So far, there is only `MonadZero` and `MonadPlus`. As Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, I use a dirty hack: `MonadAbstract` contains already all default implementations of methods for such subclasses, but doesn't actually implements the interfaces. The idea is to write for a type `Foo` a `FooMonad extends MonadAbstract implements MonadPlus, MonadCont...` class providing the mandatory method implementations. But it feels dirty, which might be the reason I hesitate.

== Arrow Subclasses ==

Situation is the same as for monad subclasses.

== Monad Transformers ==

Seems to be a must, especially `StateT` and `ContT`. Very complicated stuff, even for `MaybeT`. 

== Do Notation ==

Dunno how useful it is. Maybe I should review the concept, and give it another spin...
