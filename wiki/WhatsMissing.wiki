#summary List of missing features

= What's Missing =

== Tests ==

Tests, tests, tests.

== Monad Subclasses ==

So far, there is only `MonadZero` and `MonadPlus`.

== Arrow Subclasses ==

Situation is similar to monad subclasses.

== Monad Transformers ==

Seems to be a must, especially `StateT` and `ContT`. Very complicated stuff (for me), even for `MaybeT`. 

== Do Notation ==

I had something ugly in the old version. Maybe I should review the concept, and give it another spin...
