The transition to [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroupoids-1.2.2 semigroupoids] is nearly finished (the `Foldable` stuff isn't adapted yet). I changed from `Copointed` to `Extend` and adapted `Comonad`. Test coverage increases slowly. Next thing I want to work on are type-classes extending `Monad` and `Arrow`, but I'm still not sure how to avoid code duplication. Need more instances, too.

I'm looking for a good, real world example I could translate.

Fun fact: Today I tried to make an UML from highJ using ArgoUML, but it choked. Filed an issue...

I worked on the semigroupoid transition last weekend. I _think_ I rewired everything correctly so far. I'll concentrate on test coverage now. There are just a few additional type classes I want to include (`Monad` and `Arrow` extensions, `Foldable` stuff). After this, I think I'll add some more interesting instances like Sets and Maps.

I found out that it is hard to stay consistent given all the "historical" quirks in Haskell. Fortunately I got pointed to the semigroupoid Haskell package which tries to overcome these gaps, and has a solid theoretical background. It contains a nice [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroupoids-1.2.2 overview of the type class hierarchy], which will be my new treasure map. I got a very friendly response from the maintainer of that package, Edward Kmett, so I can get help when I'm really stuck. 

I'll start to refactor the type class part right now, so you before you rely on anything in the current structure, please take a look at the semigroupoid package description in order to see if that part will change or not.
