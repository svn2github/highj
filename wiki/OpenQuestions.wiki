#summary Things that need to be clarified

= Open Questions =

== Does inheritance for type constructors make sense? ==

E.g. How should something like an `IterableOf` work?

== Should we use composition over inheritance for type classes? ==

E.g. Pointed would not longer inherit from Functor, but have a getFunctor method. Applicative would have a getPointed (and for convenience a getFunctor) method etc. 

*Pro:* Implementation easier and more reuseable. 

*Con:* Usage gets probably more complicated.

== Curried binary Type Constructors ==

Would it be possible to work _always_ with a curried version like `_<LC<Ctor,A>,B>` instead of `__<Ctor2,A,B>`? 

*Pro:* Can be used immediately in unary type classes. Same mechanism as Haskell.

*Con:* Asymmetric, would need a "Flip" typeclass or so to change the order. Type classes like Arrow would read awkward. Security could be weakened.

== Category Package ==

  * Is it correct that MonadPlus inherits from Alternative? 
  * Is it correct that Copointed inherits from Functor?
  * The Comonad part didn't look standardized in Haskell (e.g. Copointed vs Extend)
  * Do we need MonadZero between Monad and MonadPlus?
  * What to do with the infamous Monad.fail method?
  * Can we implement monad transformers?

== Type Classes ==

  * Which other data type classes would be useful? Set, Map..?
  * Which monads would be useful? IO, Reader, Writer, State..?

== Crazy Things ===

  * Can we simulate Haskells do-notation?
